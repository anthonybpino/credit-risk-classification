# credit-risk-classification
The use of various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk.

## Repo Description/Outline:

Using lending data, a machine learning model is implimented to see if a loan is a healthy or high risk loan. The model shows us a few things:

- The model is able to predict that a loan is healthy with 100% precision and recall
- The model's precision is bit lower for high risk loans, with 87% precision and 100% recall. Overall accuracy of the model is 100%
- There are a lot more people with a loan status of 0 over 1

Overall the model seems to work great with the provided data. Seeing as it's overall accuracy is 100% based on the data provided, I would recommend this model be used by the company. Perhaps a test group could be used to further test the model.
